5.
5.1 our topic is now based on motion ?
5.2 what would be the simple problem definition?
5.3 main architecture? based on what to refer.
5.4 how to train? training process?

6. proposed approach: modified algorithms
6.1 what algorithms
6.2 why these algorithms
6.3 what did each algorithm do
6.4 what did we achieve from these
6.5 main idea

7 experimental setup:
7.1 dataset
	7.1.1 comparison to other datasets: NuScenes, Oxford Radar RobotCar, MulRan and Astyx
7.2 other algorithms comparison
7.3 environment and parameters: metrics, parameters used in algorithms
7.4 what metrics are used to compare the results based on what? accuracy etc. -> formulas
7.5 what sensor fusion techniques:
	7.5.1  
	7.5.2
	7.5.3
	7.5.4 all these together with different approaches for the training shuffling to add content as Ganesh said
